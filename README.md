# bikesharing
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to show investors how the bike-sharing model works in New York City to prove that running the model in Des Moines is a strong business proposal.
### Results
* Checkout times for users

Most users check out within the first 20 minutes. This information indicates that if bicycles are to meet demand, the system will require significant investment.
* Checkout times by Gender

The difference between males and females is in terms of the number of users.  Males tend to take slightly longer trips.
* Trips by Weekday per hour

On weekdays, the trend shows that people use the service to commute; but after get off work is when they use it more.

Males are clearly the majority of the system users, having the commute from work as the strongest time.

Males seem to rely on the system for their transportation as most are subscribers. Most users of the system are subscribers, using it weekdays. Non-subscribers use it more during the weekend.
* Gender Breakdown

Males represent 65,27%, which can mean that although the majority, the usage could be equal not in total users but the percentage of users of each gender using the service.
* Number of Bikes for User type

The number of subscribers using services is much greater than that of customers.

## Summary
From the chart of gender breakdown, we can find that men are the main customer group. In the future, we can provide different services for male users to meet customer needs. In addition, we can find that most users are subscribers, and only a small number of users are customers. We can provide and design more subscription methods and discounts to attract non-subscribers, and promote through these subscribers, for example, when subscribers introduce non-subscribers to use or join members, give subscribers bonuses.
